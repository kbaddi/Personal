# About Kiran Baddi
  ##       Pessimist by experience, optimist by will
  
### Working Style

1. Continously strive to improve and excel at what I do
2. Working in teams push me to work better and efficient. I can be collaborative and competitive (healhtily) at the same time. 
3. Open to ideas on how to get a task done better and I put forward my ideas that help team's productivity and bonding.
4. Need a nudge _now and then_ when my enthusiasm levels drop. 
5. I welcome constructive feedback. I appreciate when it's given in an informal way yet very candid.
6. I love to share what I learn and understand others' points of view.
7. Inquisitive about the latest technologies and try to keep pace with them.

### My Personal style

1. Love conversations about everything both at work and off work.
2. I am a very straight forward and too jovial at times, which may sound rude to those new to me.
3. An ardent fan of Carl Sagan. I believe I am just a spec in the star dust, but yet I can make a difference to this pale blue dot that's our home - Earth
4. Despite the point 3, I get carried away by emotiions and it's again the philosophy that brings me back to senses and go on about my work with cheerful demeanour.
5. I continuously strive to be a good citizen and a good human being that's one thing I'd never lose focus.
